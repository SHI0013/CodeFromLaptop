    <h1>How technology has a negative efffect on our lives</h1>
    <h2>By Shatakshi Shivhare</h2><br><br>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Modern technology allows people to be more connected than ever, but this may come at a price. Overuse of social media
    and mobile devices has been linked to eyestrain, difficulty focusing, and depression.
    While some forms of technology may have made positive changes in the world, there is evidence for the negative effects
    of technology and its overuse, as well.
    The overuse of technology may have a more significant impact on developing children and teenagers.
    In this article, learn about the psychological and physical health effects of technology, as well as how to create
    healthful habits with technology and avoid overuse.

    <h3>Physical Health Effects</h3>
    <h4>Isolation</h4>
    <p>Technologies, such as social media, are designed to bring people together, yet they may have the opposite effect in some
    cases. A 2017study in young adults aged 19-32 years found that people with higher social media use were more than three times
    as likely to feel socially isolated than those who did not use social media as often.
    Finding ways to reduce social media use, such as setting time limits for social apps, may help reduce feelings of
    isolation in some people.</p><br>

    <h3>Physical Health Effects</h3>
    <h4>Eyesight</h4>
    <p>Technologies, such as handheld tablets, smartphones, and computers, can hold a person’s attention for long periods. This
    may lead to eyestrain.
    
    Symptoms of digital eyestrain can include blurred vision and dry eyes. Eyestrain may also lead to pains in other areas
    of the body, such as the head, neck, or shoulders.
    
    Several technological factors may lead to eyestrain, such as:
    
    <ul>
        <li>screen time</li>
        <li>screen glare</li>    
        <li>screen brightness</li>
        <li>viewing too close or too far away</li>
        <li>poor sitting posture</li>
        <li>underlying vision issues</li>
        <li>Taking regular breaks away from the screen may reduce the likelihood of eyestrain</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>Anyone regularly experiencing these symptoms should see an optometrist for a checkup.</p><br>
    <h4>Poor Posture</h4>
    <p>The way many people use mobile devices and computers may also contribute to incorrect posture. Over time, this may lead
    to musculoskeletal issues. Many technologies promote a “down and forward” user position, meaning the person is hunched forward and looking down at the screen. This can put an unnecessary amount of pressure on the neck and spine. A 5-year study in the journal Applied Ergonomics found an association between texting on a mobile phone and neck or upper back pain in young adults.The results indicated the effects were mostly short term, though some people continued to have long-term symptoms. However, some studies challenge these results. A 2018 studyTrusted Source in the European Spine Journal found that the posture of the neck while texting made no
    difference in symptoms such as neck pain. This study concluded that texting and “text neck” did not influence neck pain in young adults. However, the study did not include a long-term follow-up.It may be that other factors influence neck pain, as well, such as age and activity levels. Correcting posture problems while using technology may lead to an overall improvement in posture and strength in the
    core, neck, and back. For example, if a person finds themselves sitting in the same position for hours at a time, such as sitting at a desk
    while working, regularly standing or stretching may help reduce strain on the body. Additionally, taking short breaks, such as walking around the office every hour, may also help keep the muscles loose and avoid tension and incorrect posture.</p>
